The app contains two panels. The top panel displays the overall distribution of crime frequency in San Francisco at certain time point. There are two drop down bars to specify crime information: one for choosing the crime type, another for choosing the neighborhood. Users can also use the Time of the Day slider bar to change the time to see how crime rate changes over time. The bottom panel contains two graphs to display specific crime information that users want to focus on. The left graph is a bar chart for the crime frequency at a specific time point in neighborhoods specified by users. The right graph is the map of San Francisco with neighborhoods that the user selected being highlighted and the unselected being grey.
