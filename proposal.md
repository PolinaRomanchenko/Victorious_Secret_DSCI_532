When looking for houses, one important factor that people will consider
is the safety of the neighborhood. Searching that information district
by district could be time consuming and exhausting. It is even harder to
compare specific crime statistics across districts like the crime rate
at a certain time point which some people might care about if their work
ends really late. It would be useful if people can just look up crime
related information across district on one mobile application. Our app
aims to help people make decisions when considering potential dwellings
via visually explore a dataset of crime statistics in San Francisco,
United State. The app provides an overview of the crime rate across
districts and allows users to focus on more specific information through
filtering via geological location,crime rate, crime type or time of the
crime.
